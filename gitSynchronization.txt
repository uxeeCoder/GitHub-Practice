Commit cycle in Git is a helpful process to reflect any changes made to the code on your local machine and commit them 
on Git repository for other developers to stay updated and get proper collaboration.
This cycle consists of make change - stage and review changes - commit changes with a meaningful message for clear understanding - push these changes to remote repository like Git - review and merge changes if needed.
The cycle keeps repeating as you move forward with the project you are wokring on.
